# Erratic breathing pattern Validity

# The relationship between breathing frequency and time will be examined using a 
# non-linear regression. The relationship should be mono-exponential with an r2 
# value of >0.8. The relationship between tidal volume and time will be examined 
# using a non-linear regression. The relationship should be mono- exponential with 
# an r2 value of >0.8. If either of these criteria are not met then “erratic 
# breathing pattern” will be reported using the following technical comment:
