# ScaleCPET - Python Rewrite
The purpose of this rewrite is to turn the spaghetti code that was written for the proof of concept into something that can be consumed through API or something that can be integrated into modern technology stacks if it is to be aquired by other companies. The long-term goals of the project are to create the following:

- Jupiter Notebook documenting the process of cleansing and manipulating the data for accurate information about the patient. 
- Flask REST API which produces json output of relevant information. 
- Modern Next.JS / Tailwind.css application that will consume the flask API for a meaningful dashboard report. 

I plan to open source the information with the permission of my mentor depending on whether it attracts interest from potential partners for aquisition.
