## Introduction:

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is a well-known, important tool in the clinical evaluation of patients with different causes of exercise limitation for patients suffering from pulmonary or cardiac conditions. Currently, there are many different systems that provide CPET testing with no real metric of standardization for clinical interpretation. Each one of these systems has limitations in the way that the data is modeled and represented within their individual software. 

With this in mind, Dr. Christopher Cooper, a professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine, and I started our journey into creating software that can help standardize CPET interpretation for clinical settings. With over months of work, we are proud to announce that our CPET Analytics software is currently undergoing testing at the David Geffen School of Medicine. 

## Information about the Software
* Uses innovative algorithms to determine the actual end of the test in order to have accurate threshold values for interpretation
* Assembles nine key variables with reference and measured values for easy interpretation of patient data
* Uses Dr. Cooperâ€™s innovative four plot graphing layout with adaptive formatting for different patients
* Natively supports the COSMED system and is currently implementing support for other CPET systems such as Vyaire 
* Produces important technical comments in regards to the validity and accuracy of the administered test
